    Given a signed message and it's authchain, validate it's authenticity.  
    A message can be signed, for example, to prove ownership of the Entity pointers that they want to modify.
  requestBody:

       The body has 3 properties. The timestamp, the signedMessage that you wish to validate and the atuchChain. 
       <br/>The structure of the authchain is described as follows: 
       <br/>- The first element of the chain is the original signer, and the one who will be used to validate against the blockchain
       <br/>- The last element of the chain contains the EHash and a signature
       <br/>- In between are ephemeral keys that can be used for signing
