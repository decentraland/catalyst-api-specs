        Hash field references the snapshot of all entities, inside entities field there are the snapshots per entity.
        Each hash is a reference to a JSON file containing one line per entity in a JSON format.

        /content/contents/{hashId} endpoint. The timestamp in the response is
        the time of the last deployment included in the snapshot.
